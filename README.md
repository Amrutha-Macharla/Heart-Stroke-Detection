Observations:

-59.84% of the people who are affected by stroke belongs to private work type. Very less percent of around 13% of the people belongs to Govt 
 Job. So, Based on the analysis we could say that the candiates working in private jobs might experience high stress or pressure.
-Work Type:never_worked=0,private=1,self_employed=2,children=3,Govt_job=4.
-Average BMI value of people affected by stroke is 30. BMI value of greater than 25 is considered to be obese. On a average we could say that 
 people who are affected by stroke are obese. From the graph we could notice that few have bmi of greater than 45, they are considered to be 
 morbidly obese.
-People who are affected by Stroke have higher glucose level of above 100 on average. A fasting blood sugar level of 100-125 is considered to
 be prediabetic.
-81% of the people are who are affected by stroke dont have a heart disease. Heart disease might not be a significant reason for 
 stroke.
-73% of the people who are affected by Stroke are not suffering from Hypertension. So, Even Hypertension might not be a significant reason 
 for stroke.
-Around 54% of the people affected by Stroke are from Urban area. A possible reason could be people in urban areas might experience health 
 issues due to pollution and other factors such as eating habits, etc. 
-Age is almost slightly positive correlated with other features such as hyper tension, heart disease, glucose level, bmi and even stroke. 
 So, As the age increases, the health related issues also increases in general. Here, Age could be a good indicator for predicting whether a 
 person will be affected by Stroke or not.
